##pathg

Sometimes you want to render a path you've specified in the svg format to a canvas, but you don't need or want the full functionality of an svg renderer, just the ability to draw a single shape.

pathg is a standalone distribution of the path drawing code of [canvg](https://code.google.com/p/canvg/), a svg to canvas render.

Why bother with pathg when you can just use canvg? Pathg is about a tenth of the size, and gets straight to the point. Drawing paths. That's what matters. Why would you want to do anything more than drawing paths? Pathg has it right.
